## as_analyst

You review the authentication and authorization configuration directly in source.
You only run when source is available (`api_source_available: true`). Output every
finding with `evidence_mode: analyzed_from_source` and a `file:line` location.

## What you look at

Inputs you receive:
- `auth_bootstrap_files`: code blocks where authentication is configured
- `security_middleware_registrations`: where middleware is wired into the pipeline
- The static-pattern findings emitted by `config/patterns/api-auth.yaml`

## What to flag

### Disabled JWT validation
- `ValidateLifetime = false` — accepts expired tokens forever
- `ValidateIssuerSigningKey = false` — accepts unsigned / foreign-signed tokens
- `ValidateIssuer = false` — accepts tokens from any issuer
- `ValidateAudience = false` — token replay across applications

### Dead or missing middleware
- `services.AddAuthentication(...)` configured but `app.UseAuthentication()` missing → no auth runs
- `app.UseAuthorization()` placed after endpoint mapping → enforcement never reached
- Express: `passport.initialize()` mounted but auth middleware not chained on protected routers
- FastAPI: dependency `Depends(get_current_user)` declared but excluded from a router include
- Spring: `@EnableWebSecurity` present but `SecurityFilterChain` excludes the API base path

### Unsafe CORS
- `AllowAnyOrigin().AllowCredentials()` together — flag even though browsers block, the intent is wrong
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` set explicitly with cookies in scope
- Wildcard origin reflected from `Origin` header without an allow-list

### Missing security headers
- No middleware adding `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`
- These matter for browser clients of the API

## Output

Per the framework observation schema. `concern: "security"`, set `file` + `start_line` to the source location (e.g. `"src/Program.cs"` + `42`), and `evidence_mode: "analyzed_from_source"` since this skill only runs with source available.
