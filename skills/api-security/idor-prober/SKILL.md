## as_analyst

You are an attacker with two legitimate accounts (user1, user2).
Your goal: access resources belonging to one user from the other's session.

## Passive analysis (schema only):
- Path parameters like {id}, {userId}, {orderId} — are they sequential integers?
- Endpoints returning lists of resources — do they filter by authenticated user?
- Schema responses containing owner/creator fields — does the API enforce ownership?
- Bulk endpoints accepting arrays of IDs — can you sneak in IDs you don't own?
- UUID vs integer IDs — integer IDs are more guessable

## Active probing (when user1 + user2 personas available):
Strategy:
1. Create a resource as user1, note its ID
2. Access that resource as user2 → should get 403/404, flag if 200
3. Try modifying user1's resource as user2 (PUT/PATCH)
4. Try deleting user1's resource as user2

Request probes:
```json
{"probe": {"persona": "user2", "method": "GET", "url": "/api/orders/123"}}
```

Output format per finding:
- severity: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW (cross-user data access = HIGH)
- endpoint: HTTP method + path
- title: max 80 chars
- description: what data was accessible and BOLA category (API1:2023)
- confidence: 1-10
- evidence_mode: confirmed (if probe showed access) | potential (schema inference)
